        <p>Plot:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Part I Gone with the Wind takes place in the state of Georgia during
            the American Civil War (1861–1865) and the Reconstruction Era
            (1865–1877). The novel opens on the eve of a rebellion in which
            seven southern states – including Georgia – declared their secession
            from the United States (the "Union") over a desire to continue the
            institution of slavery, which was the economic engine of the South.
            The story begins on April 15, 1861, on a plantation owned by the
            family of wealthy Irish immigrant Gerald O'Hara. The oldest of the
            three O'Hara daughters, 16-year-old Scarlett is willful, witty, and
            intelligent though uninterested in schooling. She is described in
            the book's opening sentence as "not beautiful" but in possession of
            a powerful ability to charm and attract men.[4] Scarlett is dismayed
            to learn that the man for whom she harbors a secret love, her county
            neighbor Ashley Wilkes, is set to announce his engagement to his
            cousin Melanie Hamilton. The next day, the Wilkeses throw an all-day
            party at their estate ("Twelve Oaks") where Scarlett spies a dark
            stranger leering at her. She learns that this man is Rhett Butler
            and that he has a reputation for seducing young women. Throughout
            the day, Scarlett attempts to turn Ashley's head by flirting
            shamelessly with every man present, including Melanie's brother
            Charles. In the afternoon Scarlett finally gets Ashley alone and
            confesses her love for him, convinced he will return it, but he says
            only that he cares for her as a friend and intends to marry Melanie.
            Stung, Scarlett reacts badly, pelting Ashley with insults about
            himself and Melanie and accusing him of being too cowardly to submit
            to his real feelings for her. As Ashley departs, Rhett Butler
            reveals himself from his hiding place in the library – he has
            overheard their whole exchange. A humiliated Scarlett claims that he
            is "not a gentleman", to which he admiringly replies "And you are
            not a lady".[5] Scarlett later learns that war has been declared and
            the men are going to enlist. Feeling petty and vengeful, she accepts
            a marriage proposal from Melanie's brother, Charles Hamilton. They
            marry two weeks later, Charles goes to war, and promptly dies of
            measles two months later. Scarlett gives birth to his child, Wade
            Hampton Hamilton.[6] As a widow, she is bound to dye her dresses
            black, wear a veil in public, and avoid conversations with young
            men. Scarlett mourns the loss of her youth, though not the husband
            she barely knew, and rues her hasty decision to marry Charles. Part
            II Melanie is living in Atlanta with her Aunt Sarah Jane, who is
            largely called by her childhood nickname "Pittypat". Scarlett's
            mother, mistaking Scarlett's depression at having lost her status as
            a belle for grief at having lost her husband, suggests that living
            with Melanie and Pittypat in Atlanta might lift her spirits. After
            moving to Atlanta, Scarlett's spirit is revived by the energy and
            excitement of living in a growing city. She busies herself with
            hospital work and sewing circles for the Confederate Army, although
            her heart isn't in it – she does these things mostly to avoid being
            gossiped about by the other women of Atlanta society. Additionally,
            she believes that her efforts may aid Ashley, with whom she is still
            deeply in love. Scarlett is mortified when she runs into Rhett
            Butler, whom she hasn't seen since her humiliation at Twelve Oaks,
            while manning a sales stall at a public dance benefiting the
            troops.[7] Rhett believes the war is a lost cause but is becoming
            rich as a blockade runner for profit. Rhett sees through Scarlett's
            "lady in mourning" disguise and recognizes her longing to dance with
            the other young people, so he bids a large amount of gold to win the
            honor of leading the first dance and chooses Scarlett as his
            partner. Scarlett scandalizes the city by dancing joyfully while
            still dressed in widow's mourning. Her reputation is saved by
            intervention from Melanie, who is now her sister-in-law and highly
            respected in Atlanta. Melanie argues that Scarlett is supporting the
            Confederate cause. Scarlett continues to act recklessly, flirting
            and going on dates while still in widow's clothes, but is
            continually protected by Melanie's endorsement. She spends much of
            her time with Rhett Butler. Rhett's sexual attraction to Scarlett is
            ever-present, and at one point he enrages her with a silky
            proposition she become his mistress. Still, she appreciates Rhett
            for his money, his sophistication, and their shared irritation with
            the hypocrisy of Atlanta society.[7] At Christmas (1863), Ashley is
            granted a furlough from the army and visits the women in Atlanta.
            Scarlett struggles to restrain her feelings for him and to remember
            that he is someone else's husband. She remains convinced that he is
            secretly in love with her and that he remains married to Melanie out
            of duty. Scarlett is heartbroken when Melanie becomes pregnant with
            Ashley's child. Part III The war is going badly for the Confederacy.
            By September 1864, Atlanta is besieged from three sides.[8] The city
            becomes desperate as hundreds of wounded Confederate soldiers pour
            in. Melanie goes into labor with only the inexperienced Scarlett and
            a young slave named Prissy to assist, as all the trained doctors are
            attending to the soldiers. The tattered Confederate States Army sets
            flame to Atlanta before they abandon it to the Union Army. Amidst
            the chaos, Melanie gives birth to a boy, Beau. Scarlett tracks down
            Rhett and begs him to take her, Wade, Melanie, Beau, and Prissy to
            Tara. Rhett laughs at this idea, explaining that Tara has likely
            been burned by the Yankees, but still steals an emaciated horse and
            a small wagon and begins driving the party out of Atlanta. At the
            edge of the city, Rhett announces that he has had a change of heart
            and is abandoning Scarlett to join the army in their final, doomed
            push. Scarlett drives the wagon to Tara, where she is relieved to
            see that Tara has avoided being burned like so many of her
            neighbors' homes. However, the situation is bleak: Scarlett's mother
            is dead, her father has lost his mind with grief, her sisters are
            sick with typhoid fever, the field slaves have left, the Yankees
            have burned all the cotton, and there is no food in the house. The
            long and tiring struggle for survival begins, with Scarlett working
            in the fields. There are several hungry people and animals, along
            with an ever-present threat from Yankees who steal or burn what
            little they can find. At one point, Scarlett kills a Yankee soldier
            who attempts to invade her home and buries his body in the garden. A
            long post-war succession of Confederate soldiers returning home stop
            at Tara to find food and rest. Eventually, Ashley returns from the
            war, with his idealistic view of the world shattered. Finding
            themselves alone one day, he and Scarlett share a passionate kiss in
            the fields, after which he declares that he can't trust himself with
            her and that he intends to move his family to New York to get away
            from her. Part IV Life at Tara slowly begins to recover, but
            exorbitant taxes are levied on the plantation. Scarlett knows only
            one man with enough money to help her – Rhett Butler. She puts on
            her only pretty dress, looks for him in Atlanta, and finds him in a
            debtor's prison. Although she nearly wins him over with a southern
            belle routine, he declines to help when he realizes her sweetness is
            an act meant to get at his money. Leaving the jailhouse in a snit,
            Scarlett meets Frank Kennedy, a middle-aged Atlanta storeowner who
            is betrothed to Scarlett's sister, Suellen. Realizing that Frank
            also has money and that Suellen will turn her back on Tara once she
            is married, Scarlett hatches a plot to marry Frank. She lies to
            Frank that Suellen has changed her mind about marrying him. Dazed,
            Frank succumbs to Scarlett's charms and marries her two weeks later,
            knowing he has done "something romantic and exciting for the first
            time in his life".[9] Wanting to keep his pretty young wife happy,
            Frank gives Scarlett the money to pay the taxes. While Frank has a
            cold and is pampered by Aunt Pittypat, Scarlett goes over the
            accounts at Frank's store and finds that many owe him money.
            Terrified of the possibility of more taxes and irritated with
            Frank's poor business sense, she takes control of the store; her
            business practices emasculate Frank and leave many Atlantans
            resentful of her. With a loan from Rhett, she also buys and runs a
            small sawmill, which is viewed as even more scandalous conduct. To
            Frank's relief and Scarlett's dismay, Scarlett learns she is
            pregnant, which curtails her business activities for a while. She
            convinces Ashley to come to Atlanta and manage her mill, all the
            while still in love with him. At Melanie's urging and with great
            trepidation, Ashley accepts. Melanie becomes the center of Atlanta
            society, and Scarlett gives birth to a girl, Ella Lorena.[10]
            Georgia is under martial law, and life has taken on a new and more
            frightening tone. For protection, Scarlett keeps Frank's pistol
            tucked in the upholstery of his buggy. Her lone trips to and from
            the mill take her past a shanty town where criminals live. While on
            her way home one evening, she is accosted by two men who try to rob
            her, but she escapes with the help of Big Sam, a black former
            foreman from Tara. Attempting to avenge his wife, Frank and the Ku
            Klux Klan raid the shanty town, where Frank is shot dead in the
            fracas. Rhett puts on a charade to keep the raiders from being
            arrested. He enters the Wilkeses' home with Hugh Elsing and Ashley,
            singing and pretending to be drunk. Yankee officers outside question
            Rhett and he says he and the other men had been at Belle Watling's
            brothel that evening, a story Belle later confirms to the officers.
            The men are indebted to Rhett, and his reputation among them
            improves somewhat, but the men's wives – except Melanie – are livid
            at owing their husbands' lives to the town madame. Later, at Frank's
            funeral, Rhett asks Scarlett to marry him.[11] She refuses at first,
            but after a little repartee, he kisses her passionately, and in the
            heat of the moment, she accepts. One year later, Scarlett and Rhett
            announce their engagement, which becomes the talk of the town. Part
            V The Bonnie Blue Flag is an 1861 marching song that refers to the
            first unofficial flag of the Confederacy. Mr. and Mrs. Butler
            honeymoon in New Orleans, spending lavishly. Upon returning to
            Atlanta, the couple builds a gaudy new mansion on Peachtree Street.
            Rhett happily pays for the house to be built to Scarlett's
            specifications, but describes it as an "architectural horror".[12]
            Shortly after moving into the house, the sardonic jabs between them
            turn into quarrels. Scarlett wonders why Rhett married her and then,
            "with real hate in her eyes",[12] tells Rhett she is going to have a
            baby, which she does not want. Wade is seven years old in 1869 when
            his half-sister Eugenie Victoria, is born. She has blue eyes like
            Gerald O'Hara, and Melanie nicknames her "Bonnie Blue" in reference
            to the Bonnie Blue Flag of the Confederacy. When Scarlett is feeling
            well again, she makes a trip to the mill and talks to Ashley, who is
            alone in the office. In their conversation, she comes away believing
            Ashley still loves her and is jealous of her intimate relations with
            Rhett. She returns home and tells Rhett she does not want more
            children. From then on, they sleep separately, and when Bonnie is
            two years old, she sleeps in a little bed beside Rhett. Rhett turns
            his attention completely toward Bonnie, pampering her and working to
            ensure her a good reputation for when she enters society. Melanie
            plans a surprise birthday party for Ashley. Scarlett goes to the
            mill to stall him there until the celebration – a rare opportunity
            to be alone together. He tells her how pretty she looks, and they
            reminisce about the old days and how far their lives have departed
            from what they imagined for themselves. They share an innocent
            embrace but are spotted in the moment by Ashley's sister, India.
            Before the party has even begun, a rumor of an affair between Ashley
            and Scarlett explodes across Atlanta, eventually reaching Rhett and
            Melanie. Melanie refuses to accept any criticism of Scarlett, and
            India is expelled from the Wilkes home. Rhett, drunker than Scarlett
            has ever seen him, returns home from the party long after Scarlett.
            His eyes are bloodshot, and his mood is dark and violent. He enjoins
            Scarlett to drink with him, but she declines with deliberate
            rudeness. Rhett pins her to the wall and tells her they could have
            been happy together. He then takes her in his arms and carries her
            to her bedroom, where they engage in an intercourse. The next
            morning, a chagrined Rhett leaves town with Bonnie and Prissy for
            three months. Scarlett is uncertain about her feelings surrounding
            Rhett, for whom she feels a mixture of desire and revulsion, and she
            learns she is pregnant with her fourth child. When Rhett returns,
            Scarlett is strangely happy for his return. Rhett comments on her
            paleness, and Scarlett tells him that she is pregnant. Rhett
            sarcastically asks if the father is Ashley; Scarlett calls him a cad
            and says that no woman would want his baby, to which he replies,
            "Cheer up, maybe you'll have a miscarriage."[13] She lunges at him,
            but misses and tumbles down the stairs. She is seriously ill for the
            first time in her life, having lost the baby and broken her ribs.
            Rhett is wildly remorseful and fears Scarlett will die. Sobbing and
            drunk, he seeks consolation from Melanie and confesses that he acted
            horribly out of jealousy about Ashley. Scarlett goes to Tara with
            Wade and Ella, seeking to regain her strength and vitality from "the
            green cotton fields of home".[14] When she returns healthy to
            Atlanta, she sells the mills to Ashley. Bonnie is four years old in
            1873. Spirited and willful, she has her father wrapped around her
            finger, and Atlanta society is charmed by Rhett's transformation
            from scandalous playboy to doting father. Rhett buys Bonnie a
            Shetland pony, teaching her to ride sidesaddle and paying a trainer
            to teach the pony to jump. One day, Bonnie asks her father to raise
            the bar to one-and-a-half feet. He gives in, warning her not to come
            crying if she falls. During the jump, Bonnie falls and dies of a
            broken neck. In the dark days and months following Bonnie's death,
            Rhett is often drunk and disheveled, while Scarlett, though equally
            bereaved, is more presentable. Melanie miraculously conceives a
            second child, but loses the baby and soon dies due to complications.
            As she comforts the newly widowed Ashley, Scarlett finally realizes
            that she stopped loving him long ago and that perhaps she never did.
            She is shocked to realize that she has always, sincerely, deeply
            loved Rhett Butler and that he has loved her in return. She returns
            home, brimming with her new love, and determined to begin anew with
            him. She discovers him packing his bags. In the wake of Melanie's
            death, Rhett has decided that he wants to rediscover the calm
            Southern dignity he once knew in his youth and is leaving Atlanta to
            find it. Scarlett tries to persuade Rhett to either stay or take her
            with him, but Rhett explains that while he once loved Scarlett
            deeply, the years of hurt and neglect have killed that love. He
            leaves and doesn't look back. In the midst of her grief, Scarlett
            consoles herself with the knowledge that she still has Tara. She
            plans to return there with the certainty that she can recover and
            win Rhett back, because "tomorrow is another day."[15]
