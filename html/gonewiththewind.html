    <p>Plot:</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Part I Gone with the Wind takes place in the state of Georgia during the
      American Civil War (1861–1865) and the Reconstruction Era (1865–1877). The
      novel opens on the eve of a rebellion in which seven southern states –
      including Georgia – declared their secession from the United States (the
      "Union") over a desire to continue the institution of slavery, which was
      the economic engine of the South. The story begins on April 15, 1861, on a
      plantation owned by the family of wealthy Irish immigrant Gerald O'Hara.
      The oldest of the three O'Hara daughters, 16-year-old Scarlett is willful,
      witty, and intelligent though uninterested in schooling. She is described
      in the book's opening sentence as "not beautiful" but in possession of a
      powerful ability to charm and attract men.[4] Scarlett is dismayed to
      learn that the man for whom she harbors a secret love, her county neighbor
      Ashley Wilkes, is set to announce his engagement to his cousin Melanie
      Hamilton. The next day, the Wilkeses throw an all-day party at their
      estate ("Twelve Oaks") where Scarlett spies a dark stranger leering at
      her. She learns that this man is Rhett Butler and that he has a reputation
      for seducing young women. Throughout the day, Scarlett attempts to turn
      Ashley's head by flirting shamelessly with every man present, including
      Melanie's brother Charles. In the afternoon Scarlett finally gets Ashley
      alone and confesses her love for him, convinced he will return it, but he
      says only that he cares for her as a friend and intends to marry Melanie.
      Stung, Scarlett reacts badly, pelting Ashley with insults about himself
      and Melanie and accusing him of being too cowardly to submit to his real
      feelings for her. As Ashley departs, Rhett Butler reveals himself from his
      hiding place in the library – he has overheard their whole exchange. A
      humiliated Scarlett claims that he is "not a gentleman", to which he
      admiringly replies "And you are not a lady".[5] Scarlett later learns that
      war has been declared and the men are going to enlist. Feeling petty and
      vengeful, she accepts a marriage proposal from Melanie's brother, Charles
      Hamilton. They marry two weeks later, Charles goes to war, and promptly
      dies of measles two months later. Scarlett gives birth to his child, Wade
      Hampton Hamilton.[6] As a widow, she is bound to dye her dresses black,
      wear a veil in public, and avoid conversations with young men. Scarlett
      mourns the loss of her youth, though not the husband she barely knew, and
      rues her hasty decision to marry Charles. Part II Melanie is living in
      Atlanta with her Aunt Sarah Jane, who is largely called by her childhood
      nickname "Pittypat". Scarlett's mother, mistaking Scarlett's depression at
      having lost her status as a belle for grief at having lost her husband,
      suggests that living with Melanie and Pittypat in Atlanta might lift her
      spirits. After moving to Atlanta, Scarlett's spirit is revived by the
      energy and excitement of living in a growing city. She busies herself with
      hospital work and sewing circles for the Confederate Army, although her
      heart isn't in it – she does these things mostly to avoid being gossiped
      about by the other women of Atlanta society. Additionally, she believes
      that her efforts may aid Ashley, with whom she is still deeply in love.
      Scarlett is mortified when she runs into Rhett Butler, whom she hasn't
      seen since her humiliation at Twelve Oaks, while manning a sales stall at
      a public dance benefiting the troops.[7] Rhett believes the war is a lost
      cause but is becoming rich as a blockade runner for profit. Rhett sees
      through Scarlett's "lady in mourning" disguise and recognizes her longing
      to dance with the other young people, so he bids a large amount of gold to
      win the honor of leading the first dance and chooses Scarlett as his
      partner. Scarlett scandalizes the city by dancing joyfully while still
      dressed in widow's mourning. Her reputation is saved by intervention from
      Melanie, who is now her sister-in-law and highly respected in Atlanta.
      Melanie argues that Scarlett is supporting the Confederate cause. Scarlett
      continues to act recklessly, flirting and going on dates while still in
      widow's clothes, but is continually protected by Melanie's endorsement.
      She spends much of her time with Rhett Butler. Rhett's sexual attraction
      to Scarlett is ever-present, and at one point he enrages her with a silky
      proposition she become his mistress. Still, she appreciates Rhett for his
      money, his sophistication, and their shared irritation with the hypocrisy
      of Atlanta society.[7] At Christmas (1863), Ashley is granted a furlough
      from the army and visits the women in Atlanta. Scarlett struggles to
      restrain her feelings for him and to remember that he is someone else's
      husband. She remains convinced that he is secretly in love with her and
      that he remains married to Melanie out of duty. Scarlett is heartbroken
      when Melanie becomes pregnant with Ashley's child. Part III The war is
      going badly for the Confederacy. By September 1864, Atlanta is besieged
      from three sides.[8] The city becomes desperate as hundreds of wounded
      Confederate soldiers pour in. Melanie goes into labor with only the
      inexperienced Scarlett and a young slave named Prissy to assist, as all
      the trained doctors are attending to the soldiers. The tattered
      Confederate States Army sets flame to Atlanta before they abandon it to
      the Union Army. Amidst the chaos, Melanie gives birth to a boy, Beau.
      Scarlett tracks down Rhett and begs him to take her, Wade, Melanie, Beau,
      and Prissy to Tara. Rhett laughs at this idea, explaining that Tara has
      likely been burned by the Yankees, but still steals an emaciated horse and
      a small wagon and begins driving the party out of Atlanta. At the edge of
      the city, Rhett announces that he has had a change of heart and is
      abandoning Scarlett to join the army in their final, doomed push. Scarlett
      drives the wagon to Tara, where she is relieved to see that Tara has
      avoided being burned like so many of her neighbors' homes. However, the
      situation is bleak: Scarlett's mother is dead, her father has lost his
      mind with grief, her sisters are sick with typhoid fever, the field slaves
      have left, the Yankees have burned all the cotton, and there is no food in
      the house. The long and tiring struggle for survival begins, with Scarlett
      working in the fields. There are several hungry people and animals, along
      with an ever-present threat from Yankees who steal or burn what little
      they can find. At one point, Scarlett kills a Yankee soldier who attempts
      to invade her home and buries his body in the garden. A long post-war
      succession of Confederate soldiers returning home stop at Tara to find
      food and rest. Eventually, Ashley returns from the war, with his
      idealistic view of the world shattered. Finding themselves alone one day,
      he and Scarlett share a passionate kiss in the fields, after which he
      declares that he can't trust himself with her and that he intends to move
      his family to New York to get away from her. Part IV Life at Tara slowly
      begins to recover, but exorbitant taxes are levied on the plantation.
      Scarlett knows only one man with enough money to help her – Rhett Butler.
      She puts on her only pretty dress, looks for him in Atlanta, and finds him
      in a debtor's prison. Although she nearly wins him over with a southern
      belle routine, he declines to help when he realizes her sweetness is an
      act meant to get at his money. Leaving the jailhouse in a snit, Scarlett
      meets Frank Kennedy, a middle-aged Atlanta storeowner who is betrothed to
      Scarlett's sister, Suellen. Realizing that Frank also has money and that
      Suellen will turn her back on Tara once she is married, Scarlett hatches a
      plot to marry Frank. She lies to Frank that Suellen has changed her mind
      about marrying him. Dazed, Frank succumbs to Scarlett's charms and marries
      her two weeks later, knowing he has done "something romantic and exciting
      for the first time in his life".[9] Wanting to keep his pretty young wife
      happy, Frank gives Scarlett the money to pay the taxes. While Frank has a
      cold and is pampered by Aunt Pittypat, Scarlett goes over the accounts at
      Frank's store and finds that many owe him money. Terrified of the
      possibility of more taxes and irritated with Frank's poor business sense,
      she takes control of the store; her business practices emasculate Frank
      and leave many Atlantans resentful of her. With a loan from Rhett, she
      also buys and runs a small sawmill, which is viewed as even more
      scandalous conduct. To Frank's relief and Scarlett's dismay, Scarlett
      learns she is pregnant, which curtails her business activities for a
      while. She convinces Ashley to come to Atlanta and manage her mill, all
      the while still in love with him. At Melanie's urging and with great
      trepidation, Ashley accepts. Melanie becomes the center of Atlanta
      society, and Scarlett gives birth to a girl, Ella Lorena.[10] Georgia is
      under martial law, and life has taken on a new and more frightening tone.
      For protection, Scarlett keeps Frank's pistol tucked in the upholstery of
      his buggy. Her lone trips to and from the mill take her past a shanty town
      where criminals live. While on her way home one evening, she is accosted
      by two men who try to rob her, but she escapes with the help of Big Sam, a
      black former foreman from Tara. Attempting to avenge his wife, Frank and
      the Ku Klux Klan raid the shanty town, where Frank is shot dead in the
      fracas. Rhett puts on a charade to keep the raiders from being arrested.
      He enters the Wilkeses' home with Hugh Elsing and Ashley, singing and
      pretending to be drunk. Yankee officers outside question Rhett and he says
      he and the other men had been at Belle Watling's brothel that evening, a
      story Belle later confirms to the officers. The men are indebted to Rhett,
      and his reputation among them improves somewhat, but the men's wives –
      except Melanie – are livid at owing their husbands' lives to the town
      madame. Later, at Frank's funeral, Rhett asks Scarlett to marry him.[11]
      She refuses at first, but after a little repartee, he kisses her
      passionately, and in the heat of the moment, she accepts. One year later,
      Scarlett and Rhett announce their engagement, which becomes the talk of
      the town. Part V The Bonnie Blue Flag is an 1861 marching song that refers
      to the first unofficial flag of the Confederacy. Mr. and Mrs. Butler
      honeymoon in New Orleans, spending lavishly. Upon returning to Atlanta,
      the couple builds a gaudy new mansion on Peachtree Street. Rhett happily
      pays for the house to be built to Scarlett's specifications, but describes
      it as an "architectural horror".[12] Shortly after moving into the house,
      the sardonic jabs between them turn into quarrels. Scarlett wonders why
      Rhett married her and then, "with real hate in her eyes",[12] tells Rhett
      she is going to have a baby, which she does not want. Wade is seven years
      old in 1869 when his half-sister Eugenie Victoria, is born. She has blue
      eyes like Gerald O'Hara, and Melanie nicknames her "Bonnie Blue" in
      reference to the Bonnie Blue Flag of the Confederacy. When Scarlett is
      feeling well again, she makes a trip to the mill and talks to Ashley, who
      is alone in the office. In their conversation, she comes away believing
      Ashley still loves her and is jealous of her intimate relations with
      Rhett. She returns home and tells Rhett she does not want more children.
      From then on, they sleep separately, and when Bonnie is two years old, she
      sleeps in a little bed beside Rhett. Rhett turns his attention completely
      toward Bonnie, pampering her and working to ensure her a good reputation
      for when she enters society. Melanie plans a surprise birthday party for
      Ashley. Scarlett goes to the mill to stall him there until the celebration
      – a rare opportunity to be alone together. He tells her how pretty she
      looks, and they reminisce about the old days and how far their lives have
      departed from what they imagined for themselves. They share an innocent
      embrace but are spotted in the moment by Ashley's sister, India. Before
      the party has even begun, a rumor of an affair between Ashley and Scarlett
      explodes across Atlanta, eventually reaching Rhett and Melanie. Melanie
      refuses to accept any criticism of Scarlett, and India is expelled from
      the Wilkes home. Rhett, drunker than Scarlett has ever seen him, returns
      home from the party long after Scarlett. His eyes are bloodshot, and his
      mood is dark and violent. He enjoins Scarlett to drink with him, but she
      declines with deliberate rudeness. Rhett pins her to the wall and tells
      her they could have been happy together. He then takes her in his arms and
      carries her to her bedroom, where they engage in an intercourse. The next
      morning, a chagrined Rhett leaves town with Bonnie and Prissy for three
      months. Scarlett is uncertain about her feelings surrounding Rhett, for
      whom she feels a mixture of desire and revulsion, and she learns she is
      pregnant with her fourth child. When Rhett returns, Scarlett is strangely
      happy for his return. Rhett comments on her paleness, and Scarlett tells
      him that she is pregnant. Rhett sarcastically asks if the father is
      Ashley; Scarlett calls him a cad and says that no woman would want his
      baby, to which he replies, "Cheer up, maybe you'll have a
      miscarriage."[13] She lunges at him, but misses and tumbles down the
      stairs. She is seriously ill for the first time in her life, having lost
      the baby and broken her ribs. Rhett is wildly remorseful and fears
      Scarlett will die. Sobbing and drunk, he seeks consolation from Melanie
      and confesses that he acted horribly out of jealousy about Ashley.
      Scarlett goes to Tara with Wade and Ella, seeking to regain her strength
      and vitality from "the green cotton fields of home".[14] When she returns
      healthy to Atlanta, she sells the mills to Ashley. Bonnie is four years
      old in 1873. Spirited and willful, she has her father wrapped around her
      finger, and Atlanta society is charmed by Rhett's transformation from
      scandalous playboy to doting father. Rhett buys Bonnie a Shetland pony,
      teaching her to ride sidesaddle and paying a trainer to teach the pony to
      jump. One day, Bonnie asks her father to raise the bar to one-and-a-half
      feet. He gives in, warning her not to come crying if she falls. During the
      jump, Bonnie falls and dies of a broken neck. In the dark days and months
      following Bonnie's death, Rhett is often drunk and disheveled, while
      Scarlett, though equally bereaved, is more presentable. Melanie
      miraculously conceives a second child, but loses the baby and soon dies
      due to complications. As she comforts the newly widowed Ashley, Scarlett
      finally realizes that she stopped loving him long ago and that perhaps she
      never did. She is shocked to realize that she has always, sincerely,
      deeply loved Rhett Butler and that he has loved her in return. She returns
      home, brimming with her new love, and determined to begin anew with him.
      She discovers him packing his bags. In the wake of Melanie's death, Rhett
      has decided that he wants to rediscover the calm Southern dignity he once
      knew in his youth and is leaving Atlanta to find it. Scarlett tries to
      persuade Rhett to either stay or take her with him, but Rhett explains
      that while he once loved Scarlett deeply, the years of hurt and neglect
      have killed that love. He leaves and doesn't look back. In the midst of
      her grief, Scarlett consoles herself with the knowledge that she still has
      Tara. She plans to return there with the certainty that she can recover
      and win Rhett back, because "tomorrow is another day."[15]
